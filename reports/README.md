# Limits and Quotas

We put limits and quotas on API requests to protect the system from receiving more data than it can handle, and to ensure an equitable distribution of the system resources. The limits and quotas are subject to change.

* Maximum number of parallel requests is 10
* 100 queries per minute
* 1000 queries per hour
* 10000 queries per day
